<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In this assignment you will be writing a Java program that indexes a web page to find the most 
frequently used words on the page. The main program will read in the contents of a file and keep a 
counter of how often each word appears using a HashTable data structure. 
The program will then print out some basic statistics about the Hashtable followed by a list of the 
top 11 most frequently used words in the list.  
</p>
  
<h3>Goals</h3>

  <p>The goals of this assignment are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gain experience with hashing.</li>
    <li>Gain experience resizing a data structure.</li>
    <li>Gain experience using comparators.</li>
    <li>Gain experience using javadoc documentation to get information about a class.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<h3>The <tt>HashTable</tt> Class</h3>

<p>The <tt><a href="assignments/p5/javadocs/HashTable.html">javadoc for the HashTable</a></tt> class
gives information about the methods you need to implement. You will implement each method as described in the javadocs.
A skeleton class is provided for you; see <tt><a href="assignments/p5/files/HashTable.java">HashTable.java</a></tt>.
Additionally, your hashtable <b>must</b>:
<ul>
  <li>be implemented using an array,</li>
  <li>handle collisions using chaining, and</li>
  <li>use <tt>LinkedList</tt>s to implement the chained bucket hashing.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The constructor for the hashtable takes two arguments.
The first is the initial size
of the hashtable.  The second is a value that indicates the maximum <i>load factor</i>
of the table.  The load factor is defined to be the number of items in the hashtable 
divided by the size of the hashtable.  The maximum load factor is a measure of how full the
hashtable is allowed to get before it will be resized.  For example, a maximum load factor of 0.8
means that, under ideal hashing (when
there are no collisions), the hashtable is allowed to get up to 80% full before it will be resized.</p>


<p>The index you will use to determine where to store an entry will be very simple.
You will call the <tt>hashCode()</tt> method on the item you need to insert or
lookup and modulo this value by the table size (to make sure it is a valid index).
One potential problem is the fact that <tt>hashCode()</tt> can return a negative
value.  For example, when you take a modulo of a negative value, the result is a 
negative value.  An easy way to deal with this is to 
take the absolute value of the hashcode.
<!--check the value of 
<tt>hashCode()</tt> modulo table size.  If it is negative, simply add table size to
the result.  This will give you a positive value between 0 and <i>table size-1</i>.
-->
</p>

<p>The <tt>dump</tt> method dumps (i.e., prints) the values in the hashtable to
a given output source.  It works by going 
through the indices in the hashtable in order (0, 1, 2, ... up to <i>table size-1</i>).
At each index it prints the the index followed by the values stored at that index.
The values at each index should be printed in the order they are stored in the 
<tt>LinkedList</tt>.  
All the output will go to the <tt>PrintStream</tt> passed as an argument.  </p>

<p>The <tt>topEleven</tt> method prints the values in the hashtable to
a given output source.  It works by going through the entire HashTable and finding the 11 entries
with the greatest value and printing them. Each word should be printed on its own line.
If there are less than 11 entries then you would print 
them all. If there are multiple items with the same value then they should be printed out in the 
order that they are stored in the HashTable. This function should never print more than 11 values. 
Order will be determined by using the compare function from the Comparator class that is passed into 
the topEleven function. </p>

<p>The <tt>displayStats</tt> method will display some statistics about the current
state of your hashtable.  When it is called it should display: the current table size,
the number of items in the table, the current load factor, 
the length of the largest chain (i.e., the maximum 
number of items stored at any one index), the number of chains of length 0
(i.e., the number of "empty" indices), and the average length of the chains of length
greater than 0.
All the output will go to the <tt>PrintStream</tt> passed as an argument. </p>


<p>Note the following for the HashTable class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplicates are allowed. This makes adding an item faster since you 
  don't have to check if it is already there.</li>
  <li><tt>lookup</tt> returns an item (of the generic type <tt>T</tt>), not a boolean.  That is, if it
  finds the item, it returns it; if not, it returns <tt>null</tt>.  The item
  may be in the table more than once, however, <tt>lookup</tt> should just return the 
  first one it finds at a given index. </li>
  <li><tt>delete</tt> returns an item (of the generic type <tt>T</tt>), not a boolean.  That is, if it
  finds the item, it returns it (and removes it); if not, it returns <tt>null</tt>.  
  Note that the item may be in the table more than once.  However, <tt>delete</tt> 
  should just remove and return the first one it finds at a given index. </li>
  <li><a name="excUpdate"></a>The constructors of the <tt>Hashtable</tt> throw <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>s if the parameters
  passed to them are not valid (see 
  <a href="assignments/p5/javadocs/HashTable.html#HashTable(int, double)"><tt>HashTable</tt> constructor documentation</a>).</li>
  <li>Your code can (and should) use methods from the <tt>Object</tt> class, such as
  <tt>equals</tt>, <tt>hashCode</tt>, and <tt>toString</tt>. </li>
  <li>You don't ever need to shrink your hashtable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html"><tt>LinkedList</tt>
javadoc</a> lists (and describes) all the <tt>LinkedList</tt> methods.  You can use
any of the <tt>LinkedList</tt> methods, so be sure to 
look over the documentation carefully to determine which <tt>LinkedList</tt> methods
you will want to use in this program.</p>


<h3>The <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> Class</h3>

<p>The WordFrequencyMain class will contain the main() function that is the entry point for your 
application. This will be where the file is read in and words are counted. The input file will 
contain only words, spacing, and punctuation. We will provide a function for you that will read in a 
line from the file, remove all punctuation, convert it to lowercase, and return an array of all the 
words on that line.

After counting the occurence of all the words in the file, your program should print out the statistics 
provided by the HashTable function as well as the top 11 most frequent words that appeared in the 
file. 

A skeleton class is provided for you; see <tt><a href="assignments/p5/files/WordFrequencyMain.java">WordFrequencyMain.java</a></tt>.

</p>

<h3> The <tt>Word</tt> Class</h3>

<p>The Word class is a container class that will store a String for the word and an integer counting 
the frequency. It will need to override the hashCode() function to properly return a hash of the 
word. It will also need to override the toString() function to use the format "( word, count)". 
The rest of the implementation details for the Word class are left for you to decide. </p>

<h3> The <tt>WordComparator</tt> Class</h3>

<p>The WordComparator class should extend from Comparator<Word>. The WordComparator class is used 
to compare two Word objects to each other. Details about the 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">Comparator<T> class can 
be found in the javadocs.</a></p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>After you have read this program page and given thought to the problem
we suggest the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are working with a partner, review the
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
  <li>Review these <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
      <a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards that are used to
      evaluate your program.</li>
  <li>You may use the Java development environment of your choice in CS 367.
      <em><b>However, all programs must compile and run on the lab computers
      for grading.</b></em> If you are going to use the CS
      <a href="?r=computerLabs">lab computers</a>, we recommend that you use
      Eclipse. You may want to review the
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/" target="_tab">Eclipse
      tutorial</a> to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers,
      you should enter "<tt>eclipse&amp;</tt>" at the prompt instead of what
      is described in the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Download the following files to your programming assignment 5	 
directory:
      <ul>
      <li><a href="assignments/p4/files/WordFrequencyMain.java"><tt>WordFrequencyMain.java</tt></a></li>
      <li><a href="assignments/p4/files/HashTable.java"><tt>HashTable.java</tt></a></li> 
      </ul>
      <br></li>
  </li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> class.</li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>HashTable</tt> class.</li>
  <li>If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make
      sure you compile and run your program to ensure that it works on the
      Linux lab computers. You can compile your Java source using <tt>javac</tt>
      in a terminal window as in this example: <dir><tt>javac *.java</tt></dir>
      and the run your program using <tt>java</tt> as in:

      <dir><tt>java WordFrequencyMain inputFile</tt></dir>.
</li>

  <li>Submit your work for grading.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>

<p>Make sure your code follows the <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
<a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards used in CS 302 and
CS 367.</p>

<p><a href="?r=coursework#Handin">Electronically submit</a> the following file
to your <b><tt>in</tt></b> "handin" directory by the due date and time (or
refer to the <a href="?r=coursework#Late">late policy</a>):</p>

<ul>
      <li>"<tt>WordFrequencyMain.java</tt>" containing your <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> class,</li>
      <li>"<tt>HashTable.java</tt>" containing your modified <tt>HashTable</tt> class,</li>
      <li>"<tt>Word.java</tt>" containing your modified <tt>Word</tt> class,
      <li>"<tt>WordComparator.java</tt>" containing your modified <tt>WordComparator</tt> class, and</li>
      <li>"<tt>*.java</tt>" only if you implemented additional classes for your program.</li>
  <br />
  <li>If you are working with a partner, only one partner submits the program 
      files, but <b>both partners must submit to his/her own hand-in directory
      a completed
      <a href="assignments/README.txt"><tt>README.txt</tt></a> file.</b>
      Students working in pairs must follow the 
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
