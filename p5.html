<h2>Overview</h2>
  
<h3>Goals</h3>

  <p>The goals of this assignment are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solidify your understanding of hashing.</li>
    <li>Gain experience resizing a data structure.</li>
    <li>Use a data structure to efficiently solve a problem.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
In this assignment, you'll implement a hash table-based generic map, and use
that hash map to determine the most frequent words in a text file. The program
then prints out a list of the 11 most frequently used words in the file.
</p>

<p>
A brute force approach to the word counter task without a sophisticated data
structure would take quadratic time. With the help of a hash map, the program
can efficiently maintain a map from words to their number of occurrences and
reduce the overall complexity to linear time under ideal hashing. This makes
it possible for the program to work on very large files.

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<h3>The <tt>SimpleHashMap&ltK, V&gt</tt> Class</h3>

<p>This generic class enables a key value K to be mapped to its associated
value V, like a word is mapped to its definition in a dictionary. The map
uses a hash table with chained buckets for collision resolution as its data
structure. The chained buckets are implemented using Java's
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html"><tt>LinkedList</tt>
class</a> (review the linked javadoc to determine how to most effectively use
it). <font color="red">Your <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> may <b>not</b> use any
other Java classes than <tt>LinkedList</tt> except where noted below.</font></p>

<p>The <tt><a href="assignments/p5/javadocs/SimpleHashMap.html">javadoc</a></tt>
for the <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> class provides information about this class and
the methods you need to implement. Implement each method as described in the
javadoc. Read it carefully before coding. We've also provided a skeleton class
for you; see
<tt><a href="assignments/p5/files/SimpleHashMap.java">SimpleHashMap.java</a></tt>.</p>

<p><b>Hash Index:</b> Call the <tt>hashCode()</tt> method on the key and
modulo this value by the table size. If <tt>hashCode()</tt> returns a negative
then the resulting hash index will be negative given how modulo works in Java.
Because of this, your hash function will check for a negative hash index and,
if negative, add table size to it to get a valid hash index.</p>

<p><b><tt>Entry</tt> Inner Class:</b>
In order to implement the generic map, you'll use an auxiliary class, named
<tt>Entry&ltK, V&gt</tt> to encapsulate the key and value in one object. This
class is implemented as an "inner class" where one class defined inside another
class, and its skeleton is defined for you in <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt>. You can
use this inner class in other classes since it is public, but you need to
use the name <tt>SimpleHashMap.Entry&lt;K, V&gt;</tt> where K and V are
replaced with the desired types.<p>

<p><b>Additional Points:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Duplicated keys are <i>not</i> allowed in a map. If the user tries to associate a value with a key that is already in the map, the old value should be replaced.</li>
    <li><tt>null</tt> values are <i>not</i> allowed in <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt>. Both keys and values should be non-<tt>null</tt>. All methods should throw a <tt>NullPointerException</tt> whenever a <tt>null</tt> argument is detected.</li>
    <li>You can assume <tt>hashCode</tt> on keys is defined properly. That is, if two keys are equal, their <tt>hashCode</tt>s must also be equal. However, collisions are possible so two different keys may result in the same <tt>hashCode</tt>. Therefore, use <tt>equals</tt> to determine if two keys match rather than using their <tt>hashCode</tt>.</li>
    <li>Your <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> should still work even if the key type class has a very bad <tt>hashCode</tt> method. If, for example, it always returns 0, your <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> should still work though its performance would be pretty bad.</li>
    <li>You must grow your hash table if the load factor is exceeded but you don't need to shrink your hash table. Recall that the load factor is the number of entries in the hash table divided by the hash table size.</li>
    <li>The <tt>entries</tt> method may use either Java's <tt>ArrayList</tt> or a <tt>LinkedList</tt> for the <tt>List</tt> of entries it returns. A naive implementation iterates over the hash table stepping through all of the buckets, many of which may be empty. A faster iteration can be done in linear time with respect to the number of entries with a combination of an unsorted auxiliary linear list, though this is not required by this assignment.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> Class</h3>

<p>The WordFrequencyMain class will contain the <tt>main()</tt> method that
reads the file and counts the words. A skeleton class is provided for you;
see <tt><a href="assignments/p5/files/WordFrequencyMain.java">WordFrequencyMain.java</a></tt>.

<p>This program takes exactly one command line argument that is the name of the
text file to be processed. If the wrong number of command line arguments is
provided or the file cannot be opened, your program should display a clear
error message and quit. You may assume that the file contains only lowercase
letters and separators, i.e., spaces and newlines ('\n'). There won't be two
consecutive separators. We'll define a <i>word</i> as a sequence of letters
separated by spaces or newlines. You may also assume the file always contains
at least one word.</p>

<p>The program should display the 11 most frequent words in the file, one word
on each line, with most frequent word first and the others in decreasing order.
If two or more words have the same number of occurrences, they should be
displayed alphabetically. If there are less than 11 different words in the
file, output all the words in the order specified above.</p>

<p>Test your program against the sample cases provided below, and make sure
they produce exactly the same results as sample outputs. All cases are designed
to be computed within less than 1 second on a modern computer, so if it takes
your program far more time than that, it's an indication that there is something
wrong in your code.</p>


<h3>Sample Cases</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleFile1.txt">sampleFile1.txt</a> and <a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleOutput1.txt">sampleOutput1.txt</a>.
        In this sample case, "it", "was", "the", "of" occurred the same number of times, so their places are determined by their alphabetical orders.
    </li>
    <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleFile2.txt">sampleFile2.txt</a> and <a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleOutput2.txt">sampleOutput2.txt</a>.
        This sample case contains only one word. So the output is that word.
    </li>
    <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleFile3.txt">sampleFile3.txt</a> and <a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleOutput3.txt">sampleOutput3.txt</a>.
        This is a big text file containing 1m words.
        Since the number of the distinct words is very small (only "a" and "b"), the processing time of this case should be pretty small (less than 1 second).
    </li>
    <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleFile4.txt">sampleFile4.txt</a> and <a href="assignments/p5/files/sampleOutput4.txt">sampleOutput4.txt</a>.
        A text file containing 300k random words.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>After you have read this program page and given thought to the problem
we suggest the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are working with a partner, review the
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
  <li>Review these <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
      <a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards that are used to
      evaluate your program.</li>
  <li>You may use the Java development environment of your choice in CS 367.
      <em><b>However, all programs must compile and run on the lab computers
      for grading.</b></em> If you are going to use the CS
      <a href="?r=computerLabs">lab computers</a>, we recommend that you use
      Eclipse. You may want to review the
      <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Ecs302/labs/EclipseTutorial/" target="_tab">Eclipse
      tutorial</a> to learn the basics. Note that on the Linux lab computers,
      you should enter "<tt>eclipse&amp;</tt>" at the prompt instead of what
      is described in the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Download the following files to your programming assignment 5	 
directory:
      <ul>
      <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/WordFrequencyMain.java"><tt>WordFrequencyMain.java</tt></a></li>
      <li><a href="assignments/p5/files/SimpleHashMap.java"><tt>SimpleHashMap.java</tt></a></li> 
      </ul>
      Do <b>not</b> use a package name for your program.
  </li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> class.</li>
  <li>Implement and thoroughly test your <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> class.</li>
  <li>If you are not using the lab computers to develop your program, make
      sure you compile and run your program to ensure that it works on the
      Linux lab computers. You can compile your Java source using <tt>javac</tt>
      in a terminal window as in this example: <dir><tt>javac *.java</tt></dir>
      and the run your program using <tt>java</tt> as in:

      <dir><tt>java WordFrequencyMain inputFile</tt></dir>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure your program passes all sample cases.</li>

  <li>Submit your work for grading.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>

<p>Make sure your code follows the <a href="?r=styleGuide">style</a> and
<a href="?r=commentingGuide">commenting</a> standards used in CS 302 and
CS 367.</p>

<p><a href="?r=coursework#Handin">Electronically submit</a> the following file
to your <b><tt>in</tt></b> "handin" directory by the due date and time (or

<ul>
      <li>"<tt>WordFrequencyMain.java</tt>" containing your <tt>WordFrequencyMain</tt> class,</li>
      <li>"<tt>SimpleHashMap.java</tt>" containing your modified <tt>SimpleHashMap</tt> class,</li>
      <li>"<tt>*.java</tt>" only if you implemented additional classes for your program.</li>
  <br />
  <li>If you are working with a partner, only one partner submits the program 
      files, but <b>both partners must submit to his/her own hand-in directory
      a completed
      <a href="assignments/README.txt"><tt>README.txt</tt></a> file.</b>
      Students working in pairs must follow the 
      <a href="?r=coursework#pp">rules for pair programming</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><b>Please turn in only the files named above.</b></em> Extra files 
clutter up the "handin" directories.</p>
